Unity Scene Level 1 and 2 for  Arachnophobia:

[]()


# Introduction: 
## Inspiration
Develop a VR environment to simulate real-life situations to help patients overcome their anxieties

## What it does

First scenario: Claustrophobia: have users running through a maze in which the walls collapse over time. 

Second scenario: Arachnophobia: have users walking pass spiders to get out of a locked room. ( The aggressiveness of spiders increase after each level)

## How we built it

We implemented Unity, Microsoft MR Tools Package, Asset Standard Package, C#, Visual Studio to build interactive VR worlds.

## Challenges we ran into

The learning curve of building a VR application is extremely high, let alone our team lacks experience with Unity and C#.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to build 3 level games for 2 phobias
We also learned many valuable programming techniques and team-work skills. 

## What we learned

How to implement a simple VR application with animated objects, insert C# script to objects, implement built-in assets, and construct a first-person character view. 

## What's next for Clementine

We think this a really great idea and if there is no time constraint, we can develop an even better, more attractive and accessible applications. With that being said, we will continue to learn more MR techniques and improve our application.
